So mats to upgrade from,
1 - 2 =  "ItemPlank","ItemPlank".
2 - 3 = "equip_nails","ItemPlank","ItemPlank","ItemPlank".
3 - 4 = "equip_nails","ItemPlank","ItemPlank","ItemPlank".
4 - 5 = "ItemScrews","ItemLog","ItemLog","ItemLog","ItemLog".
5 - 6 = "ItemLog","ItemLog","ItemLog","ItemLog","ItemPlank","ItemScrews".
6 - 7 = "ItemScrews","ItemPlank","ItemPlank","ItemPlank","ItemLog","ItemLog".

So from 1-4 nails are used from 5-7 changes to screws for all the extra braces,platform,ladders.

Damage,
[High Explosive Damage, Medium Explosive Damage, Melee Damage]].
foundation - 4 = [1,0.5,random(0.0005)].
5-7 = [0.5,0.25,0].

Damage translates too,
High Explosive Damage = C4, 
Medium Explosive Damage = Expolsive Arrow,
Melee Damage = Bladed weapons ("Hatchet_Swing_Ammo","Crowbar_Swing_Ammo","Machete_Swing_Ammo").

Maintenance,
1-7 = "ItemPlank","equip_nails".

Maintance mode SQL
1-4 = 7 days to set then foreach 3 days in MM reduce level.
5-7 = 14 days to set then foreach 6 days in MM reduce level.

Disassembly,
Never returns [equipNails,ItemStone], all other parts are returned by chance 0.3.

Then for metal fences nails wont be used 1-4 will use screws and 5-7 will be bolts but the same idea as aboue stands. (all mats for metal are found and in some cases you may have to destoy something to gain the mats)
